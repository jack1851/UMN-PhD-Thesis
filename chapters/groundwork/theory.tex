I wonder if I want to write something here?

\section{Evolution of the Standard Model}
\label{sec:lrsm:history}

This section is about the history of the Standard Model. Huh.
\cref{fig:sm} displays the known elementary particles.

      their various properities (mass, charge, spin), labels (box and circle colors),
      and interactions (brown loops). Credit to Cush on wikipedia for
      providing this diagram freely accessible and usable for any purpose.
